# Investigating the Offensive Explosion in the NBA from 2001-2018

I decided to do a statistical investigation of the NBA from 2001-2018 because I have always had a pashion for basketball, and thought it would be a good first project beacause of all the statistics available online. 


## Goals of the Study

Over the last two decades the NBA has experienced somewhat of a revolution in the way the game is played. I wanted to use various statistical methods to provied evidence either proving or disproving whether or not this was true.
